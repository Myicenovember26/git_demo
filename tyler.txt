I never would of thought that,
Feelings could get thrown in the air.
Cause I accidentally caught that.
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fall back
For example, ten minutes can go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
(?)the fucking thought of you With somebody else
I don't like that cellular convo's getting left in the wrong
Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts. (fuck)
I love you.

(Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good.)

I fucking hate you,
But I love you.
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled.
You're good at being perfect.
We're good at being troubled.
Yeah.

Girl you fucking with my emotions,
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking.
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house,
My bitch is the raddest,
Crazy who makes me the happiest,
Could make me the saddest.
Look Alice,
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me.
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving,
